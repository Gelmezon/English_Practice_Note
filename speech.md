Budget Travel

Actually budget travel never symbolize a low qiuality travel.i like budget travel very much,beacuse it is a adventure and a challenge to me, it is so exciting and fascinating.
Due to limited budget, i have to plan carefully and ensure every penny is spent wisely. 
Fortunately, i have some secret weapons to help me make my travel more affordable and enjoyable.
The first one is to book the flight tickets and hotel rooms in xianyu, which is always cheaper than other platforms.altough it is a little bit risky,but the risk is worth taking.
The second one is about transportation, the night-high-speed train  is a good choice, it is sometimes cheaper and more comfortable than plane. and the next day, i can start my journey with full energy.
Rednote is my third secret weapon, it is a very useful and convenient app, i can find the cheapest and most delicious food in the city, and  interesting places are also included.


that`s all that i want to share with everyone here,thank you for listening.

Last sunday, i attended the english corner which is a kind of social event for english learners.
When i introduced myself, i said  "hello, everyone, my name is David, i am thirteen years old" actually i am thirty years old. so everyone laughed and a man said "are you serious? you are a teenager?"
I answered him "why do you think i am a teenager?"

Today, I`d like to share some embarrassing experiences that happened to me.
Last Sunday, i went to an English corner which is a social gathering for english learners.

when it was my turn to introduce myself, I said "Hello, everyone, my name is David, and I am thirteen years old." you know i actually meant to say was that i am thirty years old. as soon as i finished speaking,everyone burst out laughing.then a guy joked "are you for real ? you are a teenager?"

i quickly corrected him "what makes you think i am a teenager?"
He replied "well, you just said you are thirteen years old, so according to what you said, you are a teenager."

everyone laughed again, and at that moment, I realized that I had almost made a huge mistake. it was so embarrassing!
