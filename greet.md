Hello, my dear friend.
It`s has been a long time since we last met.
I`ve missed you terribly.
Do you remember the time we spent together?

just imagine that we used to jog alongside the river together.
you were always faster than me.
No matter how hard i tried, i couldn`t catch up with you.
But i never gave up - i kept running and running , pushing myself to the limit.
Now i still jog alone the river,just like we used to do.
Maybe one day, we can jog together again. and i believe that day i will catch up with you .

I hope you are doing well.
I miss you badly.
Your friend, David.

Hello, my dear friend,
It`s been such a long time since we last met.
I`ve missed you terribly.
Do you remember the wonderful times we spent together?

Just imagine—we used to jog alongside the river together.
You were always faster than me, leaving me in the dust.
No matter how hard I tried, I could never catch up with you.
But I never gave up—I kept running, pushing myself to the limit.
Now, I still jog along the river, just like we used to.
Maybe one day, we can jog together again, and I believe that day, I`ll finally catch up with you.

I hope you`re doing well and thriving in everything you do.
I miss you dearly.
Your friend,
David

It has been a long time since we last met.
Recently i`m planning to visit you.
Are you still living in London?
I want to discuss something like economy and politics with you.
We will spend a pleasant time together.

As you know, I believe that Britain`s economy has been encountering some challenges recently.
Although the economy is increasing, the growth rate is still slow.
In my opinion, it`s not a good sign.

In addition, the social unemployment rate is also rising.
I`m afraid that the situation will become worse in the future.

The government must take some measures to solve these problems.
But the goverment didn`t take and effective measures.
It is terrible.
Everything is sucks.

I hope we can have a good time and discuss these issues together.
Miss you.
Your friend, David.

Dear Amy,

It has been a long time since we last met. Recently, 
I`ve been planning to visit you. Are you still living in London? 
I`d love to discuss topics like the economy and politics with you. 
I`m sure we`ll spend a pleasant time together.

As you know, I believe that Britain`s economy has been facing some challenges recently. 
Although the economy is growing, the growth rate remains slow. In my opinion, this is not a good sign.

In addition, the unemployment rate is also rising. 
I`m afraid the situation may worsen in the future. 
The government must take decisive measures to address these issues. 
However, it seems they haven`t implemented effective policies yet. 
This is deeply troubling, and the situation is quite concerning.

I hope we can have a meaningful discussion about these issues when we meet. 
I`m looking forward to seeing you soon.

Miss you,
Your friend,
David
