#### 原文

```
Hello, my dear friend.
It`s has been a long time since we last met.
I`ve missed you terribly.
Do you remember the time we spent together?

just imagine that we used to jog alongside the river together.
you were always faster than me.
No matter how hard i tried, i couldn`t catch up with you.
But i never gave up - i kept running and running , pushing myself to the limit.
Now i still jog alone the river,just like we used to do.
Maybe one day, we can jog together again. and i believe that day i will catch up with you .

I hope you are doing well.
I miss you badly.
Your friend, David.

Hello, my dear friend,
It`s been such a long time since we last met.
I`ve missed you terribly.
Do you remember the wonderful times we spent together?

Just imagine—we used to jog alongside the river together.
You were always faster than me, leaving me in the dust.
No matter how hard I tried, I could never catch up with you.
But I never gave up—I kept running, pushing myself to the limit.
Now, I still jog along the river, just like we used to.
Maybe one day, we can jog together again, and I believe that day, I`ll finally catch up with you.

I hope you`re doing well and thriving in everything you do.
I miss you dearly.
Your friend,
David
